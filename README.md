Source of **Takagi**, simple web application build with **Flask** and **Vue.js** used to conduct quick, anonymous polls over the internet.

**Takagi** was built as a university web development course project,  
That means it's simpler than It should be, to be considered a production app!

## ðŸ’» Running Locally

**It's easy to get going with developing Takagi!**

This project uses **Docker** as a development and production deployment tool, so **you need It** first!

<br>

### ðŸ“® Backend Setup
> ðŸ”¥ Execute every command in the `./backend` directory!

**If you only want to run It**, you need to:
- Spin up the whole stack as containers, simply type: 

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

This will spin up all the necessary containers and expose Takagi service **API** at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

<br>

**If you want to make changes** to the **Flask** app, you need to:
- Install **Python 3.8**, then projects requirements.
  
  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Also, It's *optionally* development requirements.

  ```bash
  pip3 install -r dev-requirements.txt
  ```

- After that spin up **Redis** and **MongoDB** as containers.
  
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d redis mongo
  ```

- Run `main.py`, entry point for Flask app.

  ```bash
  python3 ./main.py
  ```

  This will spin up databases, and run Python code with the development server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

<br>

### ðŸ“¦ Frontend Setup
> ðŸ”¥ Execute every command in the `./frontend` directory!

If **you want to make changes** to the **Vue.js** app, you need to:
-   Install **NPM**, then projects requirements.

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

-   To then serve a website, simply type:

  ```bash
  npm run serve
  ```

This will create a development web server at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
And It's a lot simpler!

## ðŸš§ Contributing

**You are more than welcome to help me improve Takagi!**

Just fork this project from the `master` branch and submit a Pull Request (PR).
If you are modifying backend you should also run `pytest` functional tests inside `backend/tests` directory.
